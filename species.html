				HUMAN
				<br>
				<img src="img/species/human.png">
				<p>
						The Humans (Homo sapiens), also known as Terrans, were a warp-capable humanoid species from the Alpha Quadrant.
						The species originated from the planet Earth in the Sol system. Humans were the only surviving race of several
						sentient/intelligent species to have evolved from the Genus Homo.
						By the 24th century, Human society had changed from what it was for most of recorded history. On Earth, hunger,
						war, disease, famine, and poverty had largely been eliminated. The acquisition of wealth was no longer the primary
						driving force in the lives of many Humans. A great deal of emphasis was placed on the importance of continued social
						and personal development. Thanks to the non-currency based New World Economy and the development of replicators, material needs were largely satisfied.

				VULCAN

				<p>
					The Vulcans, or Vulcanians[1], are a warp-capable humanoid species from the planet Vulcan. They are widely known for their logical minds and stoic culture.
					The Vulcans were once an extremely violent and emotional people who waged almost constant warfare on one another.
					As their level of technology improved, the Vulcans eventually reached a point where their violent nature threatened the extinction of their own species.
					In an effort to avoid this fate, a Vulcan named Surak developed a new philosophy, thereby igniting the Time of Awakening. Surak maintained that the root
					cause of all the problems on Vulcan lay in the uncontrolled outpouring of the people's emotions. His followers swore to live their lives by an ethical system
					devised by Surak and based purely on logical principles.

				ANDORIAN
				<br>
				<img src="img/species/andorian.png">
				<p>
					Most Andorians were blue-skinned with white or silver hair. An Andorian subspecies called the Aenar had white skin and, unlike blue Andorians, were blind and telepathic.
					Andorians and Aenar were genetically compatible and could produce offspring. Andorians had a higher metabolic rate than Humans, which could theoretically permit a Human
					opponent to best an Andorian in hand-to-hand combat by simply exhausting them. This also made them especially vulnerable to phase-pulse infection; even minor phase
					injuries could prove fatal. (ENT: "United") However, they demonstrated resistance to a wide range of environmental conditions. In a climate where the temperature was
					near the boiling point of water, an Andorian could still thrive, despite losing 10% of their body weight in two days.
